# Introducing Niuware WebFramework

Niuware WebFramework is a lightweight and ready to use PHP framework for developing full MVC and MVP web applications using synchronous and asynchronous requests.

The latest version integrates the [Eloquent ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/master/eloquent) (well known for its use in Laravel Framework) for implementing automatic models associated with your application database and Twig for rendering templates. Now migrations are easy to use through the framework console either in the terminal or web modes.

<br />
## One, two, three installation

1. Download the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/niuware/web-framework.git).
2. Run `composer install` to install the Eloquent ORM (Illuminate/database) component.
3. Enjoy!

<br />
## The basics

Suppose you have a web application to sell apples (why not?). You need to add a cart web page at some point, so you just need to define 3 things:

### 1. First, the Route

You need to say to the framework the path for accessing your cart. For example:

{% highlight php %}
[routes.php]

<?php

... 

'my-cart' => ['Cart']

{% endhighlight %}

Now your web application can be accessed through the following URL:

> http://myurl.com/**my-cart**

### 2. Second, the Controller

You have defined the path, now is time to define who will listen to it. For this to happen, it's as simple as defining a method with the same name in a Controller class named as you wrote in the previous step. For example:

{% highlight php %}
[Cart.controller.php]

<?php

class Cart extends Controller {

    public function myCart($params = []) {

        HtmlResponse::getInstance()->render($this);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### 3. Third, and lastly, the View

Your application has a path, the listener,... what is missing? Yep, the thing to display your stuff. The easiest way is just adding a file with the same name as your path and the framework will do the rest for you. For example:

{% highlight html %}
[my-cart.view.twig]

<h1>This is my cart</h1>

{% endhighlight %}

<br />
## What to do now?

You've just realized how easy is to create and start running your new web application, but the framework is not just this. You need to know the cool stuff like how easy is to accept and restrict HTTP requests from Controllers and API classes, define custom view names, reusing Controllers, add custom classes and functions as well as using Eloquent Model classes and the database migration and seeding feature.
